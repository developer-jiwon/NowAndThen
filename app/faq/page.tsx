  {
    question: "Do I need to sign in?",
    answer: "No, but signing in syncs your timers across devices."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data private?",
    answer: "Yes. Local storage for anonymous use, encrypted cloud for signed-in users."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between categories?",
    answer: "Pinned for urgent deadlines, General for work tasks, Personal for life events, Custom for anything else."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I recover deleted timers?",
    answer: "No. Use 'Hide' instead of 'Delete' to keep timers for reference."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when a timer expires?",
    answer: "It automatically switches to 'Days Passed' mode and counts upward, perfect for tracking anniversaries or how long since a deadline."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I duplicate timers?",
    answer: "Yes, use the three-dot menu on any timer and select 'Duplicate'."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I edit a timer after creating it?",
    answer: "Yes, click the timer to edit the title, date, or time. Changes save automatically."
  },
  {
    question: "How many timers can I create?",
    answer: "No limit. However, we recommend keeping pinned timers under 10 for better focus."
  },
  {
    question: "Does it work offline?",
    answer: "Yes, the app works offline. Changes sync when you're back online if you're signed in."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I set reminders or notifications?",
    answer: "Currently no push notifications, but you can bookmark specific timers to check regularly."
  },
  {
    question: "What time zones does it support?",
    answer: "Timers use your device's local time zone automatically. No manual time zone setting needed."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a mobile app?",
    answer: "The web app works great on mobile browsers. You can add it to your home screen for app-like experience."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I share timers with others?",
    answer: "Currently timers are private to your account. Sharing features may be added in future updates."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I forget my login?",
    answer: "We use Google OAuth, so you'll use your Google account. If you can't access Google, your local timers will still work."
